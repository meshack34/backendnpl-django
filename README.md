# Online Exam Generator  
### 
The "Online Exam Generator" is a user-friendly web-based platform built on Django, a high-level Python web framework. It simplifies the creation, management, and administration of online exams with its intuitive interface and robust functionality. Educators and students benefit from features such as quiz creation, exam customization, performance analytics, and secure proctoring options. Leveraging Django's capabilities along with Django templates for display, the platform ensures seamless interaction and usability for users.
Meanwhile, the "Question Generator" project introduces an advanced framework for automatically generating reading comprehension-style questions from textual data. Utilizing transformer-based natural language processing (NLP) models and integrated with Django, the system excels in producing both full-sentence questions and multiple-choice questions. It significantly enhances the efficiency of educational content creation and assessment processes.
Key dependencies used in the "Question Generator" project, including PyTorch, Transformers Library, spaCy (en_core_web_sm), and NumPy, are integrated seamlessly with Django for efficient data handling and processing. Moreover, Django templates are employed for rendering dynamic content and user interfaces, providing a cohesive and interactive experience for educators and students.
Additionally, MySQL is utilized as the database management system (DBMS) to store and manage data related to exams, questions, user accounts, and performance analytics. The combination of Django, Django templates, and MySQL ensures robust data management, security, and scalability for the platform.
Through sophisticated text processing techniques, including sentence segmentation and entity recognition, the system extracts relevant information from the input text to construct meaningful questions. Robust error handling mechanisms and quality evaluation modules are incorporated to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the generated questions.
In summary, the "Question Generator" project, integrated with Django and MySQL, serves as a versatile tool for educators, content creators, and researchers, streamlining the creation of educational materials and fostering effective learning experiences. Its integration of advanced NLP techniques and technologies with Django web framework contributes significantly to the advancement of educational technology.
